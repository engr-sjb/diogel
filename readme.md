# Diogel

###### Created By Stephen Jersuit Benyah www.github.com/engr-sjb

Diogel is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) application designed to ensure the secure, trustless, and reliable transfer of critical digital information upon the owner's death or incapacitation. This can be owner's will, hidden assets, memories, final message, work documents and so on. Basically, anything digital that one wants to make sure ends up in the right people's hands, only, and when they are no more. By leveraging modern cryptography, a P2P network built on custom framing protocols.

Diogel solves the problem of digital inheritance without relying on a centralized, trusted third party. This document outlines the complete architecture of Diogel, from its philosophical underpinnings and core cryptographic ceremonies to its advanced features.
