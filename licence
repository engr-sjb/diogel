SUMMARY
This repository (the "Project") is proprietary. You may only view and contribute to the Codebase only under the terms below. You may not ever copy, republish, redistribute, incorporate, or otherwise reuse the Codebase or  modified versions outside the Project. Use of the Codebase, contribute, or any derivatives works for training, fine-tuning, evaluation, creation of embeddings, or otherwise improving machine learning or AI models or systems is expressly prohibited. The Project Owner retains exclusive rights in the whole universe and beyond to distribute compiled binaries (the "Final Build") and to license those binaries to third parties under separate terms and conditions of their choosing.

DEFINITIONS
"Project" means the repository that is located at "https://github.com/engr-sjb/diogel" and "https://gitlab.com/engr_sjb/diogel" and any branches and submodules.
"Codebase" means the source code, build scripts, configuration, tests, documentation, and developer/engineer-orientated artifacts in the project.
"Final build" means the binary/artifact complied or packaged by the Project Owner and explicitly distributed by the Project Owner.
"Machine Learning Training" means any process that uses data (including source code, metadata, documentation, or derived representations such as embeddings or feature vectors) to train, fine-tune, validate, evaluate, or otherwise improve machine learning, generative AI, or artificial intelligence models, systems, or services.
"Contributors" means any person or entity submitting contributions to the Project.
"Project Owner" means the copyright holder(s) named above.

LICENSE GRANT (VIEW & CONTRIBUTION ONLY, NOTHING LESS)
1. The Project Owner grants you a limited, non-exclusion, non-sublicensable right which can be modified by the Project Owner at their convenience to :
      a. View the Codebase within this repository for purpose of review and contribution.
      b. Submit contributions for consideration under the Contribution License Agreement which can be modified by the Project Owner at their convenience.
      c. You should own the rights to all and any contributions you want to make this repository before contributing.

2. If the Project Owner accepts your contribution, that contribution becomes part of the Project and is governed by this license and the Contributor license Agreement.

PROHIBITION USES (NO TRAINING / NO REUSE)
3.Except as explicitly permitted here, you may NOT:
   a. Copy, redistribute, publish, sublicense, sell, or otherwise make available the Codebase (or portion) outside this Project.
   b. Incorporate the Codebase, in whole or part, into any other software, service, dataset, or product.
   c. Use the Codebase, or any. portion thereof, for Machine Learning Training, including but not limited to:
      i.Pre-training, fine-tuning, or continue training of models.
      ii. Creating embeddings, vector representation, or feature datasets derived from the Codebase.
      iii. Producing synthetic data, paraphrases, or derivatives intended for model training or evaluation.
      iv. Using the Codebase to evaluate or benchmark mL/AI models if such evaluation would retain or reproduce proprietary content outside this Project.
   d. Reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract the Codebase from any Final Build to circumvent these prohibitions.

FINAL BUILDS / END USER LICENSE
4. The Project Owner retains exclusive right to produce, distribute, and license Final Builds. End users may use Final Builds only under terms the Projects Owner supplies (e.g., an EULA). The distribution of Final Builds does not grant any rights to the underlying Codebase, nor to use any of the Codebase content for Machine Learning Training.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & CONTRIBUTIONS
5. Copyright and other IP rights in the Codebase remain with the Project Owner and contributors as described in the contributor License Agreement. Contributions accepted into the Project are licensed to the Project are licensed to the Project Owner under that agreement to ensure consistent rights and the ability to enforce the anti-training restrictions.

TERM & TERMINATION
6. This license is effective until terminated. The Project Owner may terminate granted right upon breach, including any use law for violations, including but not limited to breaches related to Machine Learning Training.

NO WARRANTY
8. THE CODEBASE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY. THE PROJECT OWNER IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE CODEBASE.

GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION
9. This license and any dispute, controversy or claims arising out of aor relating to this License shall be governed by and construed inn accordance with laws of England and Wales.
